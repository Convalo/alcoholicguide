<p>In tourist-laden cities – Los Angeles for example – when you hear the word “guide” you might think of a tour guide. Someone who points out the landmarks and celebrity homes, etc.</p>

<p>That’s not the case, however, with alcoholic guides. An alcoholic guide in most cases is more of a guide book, which can also be found online. </p>

<p>The guide provides an abundant amount of information about alcoholism, its symptoms, and where one can seek treatment depending upon where they live.</p>

<p>But in many cases an alcoholic guide is much more detailed than a listing of detox and rehab centers. These centers may not have stars behind their names much in the same way restaurants in travel guides do.</p>

<p>Alcoholic guides instead provide a wealth of information everyone should read and consider before entering detoxification and rehab.</p>

<p>Alcoholic guides take you step-by-step through the process of treating alcoholism and maintaining sobriety afterward.</p>

<p>A strong online guide explains the treatment options such as inpatient vs. outpatient, or when might be the best time for someone to enter rehab. </p>

<p>Alcoholic guides also inform a person as to what outcome they can expect if they do or do not complete the program.</p>

<p>In the “What Is Alcoholism” section that many alcoholic guides offer, we can learn much more about alcoholism and how it affects our day-to-day living. </p>

<p>We are given insight into the warning signs of alcoholism, withdrawal symptoms, binge drinking and drinking and drugs, among many more topics.</p>

<p>Drill down further and you’ll more-than-likely find a support section, which suggests options you can take to help you or a loved one recover from their addiction. </p>

<p>Most alcoholic guides provide an overall atmosphere of the rehabilitation centers they feature. Here is where you read up on a center’s atmosphere, what sort of people are enrolled there.</p>

<p>Resources such as an “about” section will reveal the legitimacy of the rehabilitation center you’re interested in question, while the article/blog section supplies true stories from those who have suffered through addiction.</p>

<p>No matter who you are or where you consider for rehabilitation, no one wants to see you continue to suffer with your addiction. Nor does anyone want to see you receive subpar services for your addiction.</p>

<p>This makes the alcoholic guide an invaluable resource with which you can learn about addiction, understand the best program for you, and find the best rehabilitation center that fits your needs and tastes.</p>

<p>The only step you have to take afterward is dedicate yourself to finding, then maintaining a healthy substance-free life.</p>
